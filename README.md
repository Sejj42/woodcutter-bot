# DISCLAIMER:

This bot is ONLY used for educational purposes. Please do not attempt to use this on live servers as it is considered cheating and you will probably be banned.

## General Notes

- Default location: Make sure your toon is placed in between the two willow trees in Draynor and are sufficiently zoomed out.
- You may change the coords in the coords.js file to match a different surrounding with different trees.
- Bot is designed to drop logs once inventory is full, but I might add a banking option in the future.

## Make sure you:

- Have node.js installed on your machine.
- Coords are based on a 1920\*1080 resolution screen. If you are using a different resolution, check for new coordinates (you can print screen and use Paint to view coords) and adjust the default ones accordingly.
